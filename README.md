### üèπ About

Robinhood Designs is a local 3D printing company based out of Tulsa, Ok - Specializing in custom accessories for major power tool brands.  Sometimes I design other stuff.

Every eCommerce platform today charges a fee to do basically the same thing - Store products in a database, display them in a visually pleasing way, and a direct POS system.  I needed only 2/3 of these features as I currently only provide my products on Ebay & Etsy.  I was unable to find a platform that would allow me to replace the "purchase button" with a link that would direct the customer to my Ebay/Etsy/Amazon page - Not to mention each platform comes with a montly fee + domain fees.

I figured I could make a custom eCommerce site without a POS.
